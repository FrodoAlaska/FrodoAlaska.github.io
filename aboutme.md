# What Is This?
Performance, communication, and dedication. Those are the things that I extremely care about. Without them, a game will not be fun. Without them, a game will be another slop of mechanics that make no sense. 

I learned how crucial performance can be since I spent the beginning of my game development years working on a very low-end PC. It really taught me how to squeeze every last drop of performance. That is why I ended up learning graphics APIs like OpenGL and Direct3D11. I made plenty of game engines, learning from each as I went along. 

While I was freelancing for 2 years, I learned how important communication really is. Sometimes, the person right in front will not know what they need. You'll have to really know your tools and what you can provide to them. Not only that, communication relates very much to game development. You'll have to convey a certain feeling or emotion through gameplay. That requires a little bit of knowledge on how to communicate well. 

And as for dedication, it is something I've had ever since I started this journey. I made games, game engines, tools, and many more applications just out of pure passion. I learned to program in C++, Java, and C#. I used game engines like Godot and Unity. I made my own game engines, allowing me to learn even more things like physics and graphics programming. And I even dwelt deep and created my own data serialization language for my games.

Just expect a lot of blogs about these topics on here.
