## Engine Devlogs 
- A Custom Resource Format: Talk about NBR, why you made it, how you made it, and the tools you made for it.

- The GUI Situation: Talking about my goals with the GUI editor, what libraries I'm going to use, and how I implmeneted it.

- Renderer: Since the "renderer" is a complicated beast of a system, let's break it up into multiple devlogs 
    * Light Up My Day: Everything I learned about lighting, blinn-phong, blinn, why not PBR, etc..
    * Compute and instancing and how render commands work in the engine. Show an example scene where instancing or compute shaders are being used.
    * The render pass system and how it works. Talking about different passes. For example, the depth pass, the shadow pass, the bloom pass, the post-proccessing pass, etc...
    * My super simple particle system and billboarding. 
    * Shadows and how annoying and "incomplete" they are. 
    * Animations and everything that entailed that.

- Begin The Scene: Talk about the scene and entity systems

- What To Work On Next?: Talk about the annoyance of trying to find the next system in the engine to work on and how it is better to proabably make a game while making the Engine

- To Wrap Or Not To Wrap: Talk about the idea of either wrapping a certain third-party library around our implementation or creating it from scratch instead.

- The Frustrating World Of Fonts: Fonts. Obviously.

- My Engine Looks Like Someone: Talk about my influences with this engine and where I got most of my ideas from. The Cherno, The Kohi Engine, Game Engine Arch book, Jon Blow, Handmade Hero, etc...

## Other 
- Leaving The C++ Mudhole: This is a devlog long in the making. Talk about switching to Odin and what are the pros and cons of that. What I gained and what I missed. Oh this shit is gonna be so lit hell yeah.

- My Toxic "Made By Me" Trait - Talk about how I need to have everything made in house and never use any library or third-party frameworks, and how that did not benefit me in the slightest and even pushed me back.

- Irritating C++: Talk about how _old_ C++ is and _feels_. How terrible it is for some projects that use the Win32 API and talk about your experience with trying to migrate projects to Linux.

- Writing Blogs In 2025: Talk about myy experience with writing blogs over the past 2 years and what I did wrong and what I could have done better. 

- Why I Write C Code In C++: Talk about my C++ writing style and how it is _heavily_ influenced by C and why I do it this way.

- Game Development -- In it for the long run: Talk about how many people are just not fit for game development and how it is a long and hard process that requires years of dedication.

- What's The Point Of Game Development?: Wouldn't it be more "useful" to go into roles like cybersecurity or even make useful application for people? Does gamedev really matter in the grand scheme of things? Making a game that will be played by some loser asshole in their mother's basement? But what about the normal people? The people that have terrible jobs and come back at the end of the day to relax and play your game? These people are dependant on you for enjoyment? But, still, does it really matter? Wouldn't it be better to learn cybersecurity to solve global problems? Help out the world and society in the long run? What's the point of game development? What's the point of games?

- The Undersold Art Of Games: Talk about how everyone just underestimates how powerful stories and games can be in general. And how a lot of "gamers" are not truly appreciating it. Pretentious maybe?

- Why I Think Politicians Should Think More Like Programmers: Talk about how politicians are very emotional people who are very impractical about certain things. They will go on a crusade, swearing that _their_ solution is the _only_ and the most correct answer to many problems. And how that's fucking dumb when you put it into a programming problem. There is no perfect solution. There are only imperfect ones that are close/good enough.

- GameDev YouTube: The Good And The Bad: Talk about how educational content in youtube when it comes to gamedev is only valuable when you get into the details. And how the funnny haha videos are really irretating and annoying and kind of demotivating. Talk about my qualms and my idea of becoming youtuber and how I really sort of hated it and regret it. How "essays" aren't really essays on youtube. They're just opinioniated videos. Which is fine, just to don't call them "essays" or "documentatries". I don't know. Just riff on youtubers. It's fun.

- Realisim In Games And Why I Hate Them: Talk about how older games were way more fun because they were trying to be a _game_. A toy. They did not care about being super realistic and "deterministic". They were just trying to be fun. Nowadays, games are either trying to sell you more dopamine to make money or are so divorced from their origins that they don't feel like games anymore. They feel like movies where you can press X a lot. RPGs, RTSs, Platformers, Hack 'n Slashes, and every other genre is just following a forumla now that is extremely annoying and not fun. God damn it, I love older games, man.
