- My Toxic "Made By Me" Trait - Talk about how I need to have everything made in house and never use any library or third-party frameworks, and how that did not benefit me in the slightest and even pushed me back.

- What's The Point Of Game Development?: Wouldn't it be more "useful" to go into roles like cybersecurity or even make useful application for people? Does gamedev really matter in the grand scheme of things? Making a game that will be played by some loser asshole in their mother's basement? But what about the normal people? The people that have terrible jobs and come back at the end of the day to relax and play your game? These people are dependant on you for enjoyment? But, still, does it really matter? Wouldn't it be better to learn cybersecurity to solve global problems? Help out the world and society in the long run? What's the point of game development? What's the point of games?

- The Undersold Art Of Games: Talk about how everyone just underestimates how powerful stories and games can be in general. And how a lot of "gamers" are not truly appreciating it. Pretentious maybe?

- Why I Think Politicians Should Think More Like Programmers: Talk about how politicians are very emotional people who are very impractical about certain things. They will go on a crusade, swearing that _their_ solution is the _only_ and the most correct answer to many problems. And how that's fucking dumb when you put it into a programming problem. There is no perfect solution. There are only imperfect ones that are close/good enough.

- GameDev YouTube: The Good And The Bad: Talk about how educational content in youtube when it comes to gamedev is only valuable when you get into the details. And how the funnny haha videos are really irretating and annoying and kind of demotivating. Talk about my qualms and my idea of becoming youtuber and how I really sort of hated it and regret it. How "essays" aren't really essays on youtube. They're just opinioniated videos. Which is fine, just to don't call them "essays" or "documentatries". I don't know. Just riff on youtubers. It's fun.

- Realisim In Games And Why I Hate Them: Talk about how older games were way more fun because they were trying to be a _game_. A toy. They did not care about being super realistic and "deterministic". They were just trying to be fun. Nowadays, games are either trying to sell you more dopamine to make money or are so divorced from their origins that they don't feel like games anymore. They feel like movies where you can press X a lot. RPGs, RTSs, Platformers, Hack 'n Slashes, and every other genre is just following a forumla now that is extremely annoying and not fun. God damn it, I love older games, man.
