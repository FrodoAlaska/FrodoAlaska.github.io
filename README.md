# What is this?

This is a website made to post blogs about some thoughts I have, projects I'm making, and other random tech stuff.
It is nothing special as I am still a beginner at this. Beware, however, I am horrible at writing intriguing articles...
viewer's discretion is advised. 

# Blogs?

Yes, blogs. You might say, "What's so important about you to make a website about yourself you self-centered, narcissistic prick?" First of all...
what the hell, dude? Second, the idea is to document my journey with game development to look back at it in the future.
I want to be able to use these blogs as a portal to my past self, seeing what I was up to at the time. That's all. Now, please
go back to whatever you were doing and stop procrastinating.
