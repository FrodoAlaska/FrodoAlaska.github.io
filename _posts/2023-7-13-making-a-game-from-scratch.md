# What?
When you read the title of this post you probably had a lot of questions in your head. For example, "Why?" and "WHY THE HELL?!!!!"
I understand. Let me explain my case, though. Hopefully, by the end of this post you'll understand why I doing what I am doing, what
are my plans, and how do I exactly tackle the problems I face in a lower level enviorment as the one I am in... or, maybe, you'll 
just not understand and that's fine as well.
