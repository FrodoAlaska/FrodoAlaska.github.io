# The Fear
Ever since I was a kid, I was always afraid of failure. I can't really tell you why. It could be some traumatic even my brain decided to forget or burry deep down. It could be the way I was raised by my parents and--to a greater extent--my environment. I'm only a pesky game programmer, however, not a psychologist so I cannot really tell you what has really caused this fear or from where it orignated. 

One thing I can tell you, though, is that "fear" has seeped into my life in more ways than I intended. My work, my relationships, my attidue, and even in video games. A fear so visious and cruel it did not tolerate my ambitions or goals. It did not care about the people around me. It, to no fault of its own, made sure to keep me from failing. 

I can tell you about all the times this fear has ruined me finacially and socially. But this is a tech blog so I'm going to talk about programming instead.

# The Fear In Action 
I'm a self-taught programmer. This might seem like irrelavnt information currently but it will make sense in a second. When I first got into programming, I had no one to help me or guide me. There was no one to tell me what to learn or how to learn it. I just winged it. Watching tutorials here and reading books there. Perhaps the occasional blog and never paid courses because I was, and still am, broke as shit. And, right here, is when the fear first emerged. 

I was afraid to start a project on my own without the help of a tutorial. Of course, all who start out feel this way. Tutorials are so comfortable. The code is right there for you. There's a guy (or girl no discrimination) telling you exactly what to do and when to do it. The carpet is laid out for you. All that is required of you is to walk. Do you care about how the carpet was laid out? Do you care about how the carpet was made? Do you even know where you are going? It doesn't matter. At least it didn't matter to me. I just wanted to program. I didn't know any better. 

I don't how people really get our of tutorial hell or why they got into it in the first place. But, for me, it was because of the fear. Once again, the tutorials were a safe house. Why should I go out to the scary world out there? Well the answer is to learn, of course. But I had no idea. I was afraid to start a project because I didn't want to fail. I didn't want to leave a project unfinished. It had to be finished. And what it didn't use the best code practises? What if I programmed it in the wrong, clearly, slower language? What if I used the wrong IDE? I could go on a rant about how the tech social media is filled with invalid opinions and people who talk about unecessary ideas... but I won't. I do not blame anyone for this but me. I'm an adult. I'm responsible for my own actions and mistakes and this one is no different. 

I could have made a small calculator with Java. I could have made a CLI application that just takes a string and flips it. I could have just made a small stupid game. Would these projects have had the best code? No. Would they have been the fastest? No. Most effecient? Absolutely no. Does it matter? Of course not! Did it matter at the time? Unfortunately, it did. And, for that reason, I did not do them. What did I do you might ask? Well, hack away at tutorials and migrating from programming language to programming language and from game engine to game engine. I went from Java to JavaScript to C# to Unity to C++ to Godot to Rust to Java again to C++ again then to C and then to C++ again. You see? It was insane.  

My fear of failing at a project forced me to move around plenty. Never had a place to call my home. 

# The Fear When Confronted 
// In conclusion: I just think too highly of myyself and I should just fucking fail and learn.
